# Use Cases

Real-world applications for parametric weather insurance.

---

## 1. Smallholder Farmers

**Problem**: Farmers in developing countries often can't access traditional insurance. When drought hits, they lose everything.

**Solution**: Purchase drought protection before planting season. If rainfall drops below threshold during growing period, automatic payout helps cover losses.

**Example**: A farmer in Kenya pays 0.01 ETH (~$30) for coverage. If rainfall stays below 50mm for the month, they receive 0.1 ETH (~$300) automatically.

## 2. Outdoor Event Organizers

**Problem**: Music festivals, weddings, and sporting events can be ruined by unexpected rain. Traditional event insurance requires lengthy claims processes.

**Solution**: Buy flood/rain protection for the event date. If rainfall exceeds threshold, payout covers losses.

**Example**: Festival organizer buys heat protection. If temperature exceeds 40°C on event day, they receive payout to cover refunds and logistics.

## 3. Agricultural Supply Chain

**Problem**: Logistics companies transporting temperature-sensitive goods (produce, flowers, pharmaceuticals) face losses when extreme weather causes delays or spoilage.

**Solution**: Purchase frost or heat protection for transit routes. Automatic payout if temperatures hit dangerous levels.

**Example**: Flower importer buys frost protection. If temperature drops below 0°C at origin, payout covers spoiled inventory.

## 4. Renewable Energy Producers

**Problem**: Solar and wind farms have variable output depending on weather. Extended cloudy periods or calm winds reduce revenue.

**Solution**: While current implementation focuses on temperature/rain, the model extends to solar radiation and wind speed data.

**Example**: Solar farm operator hedges against prolonged cloud cover with automatic payouts during low-radiation periods.

## 5. Tourism Industry

**Problem**: Beach resorts, ski lodges, and tour operators depend heavily on weather conditions. Bad weather means cancellations and refunds.

**Solution**: Automatic compensation when weather doesn't meet expected conditions.

**Example**: Ski resort buys protection if temperature exceeds 5°C (no snow). Payout offsets lost bookings.
